        This article in The Conversation describes the need for urgent reductions in fossil fuel burning in light of
        the larger than expected cooling effect of aerosol on the climate, as highlighted in our recent work on
        <a href="{{ 'projects/shiptracks.html' | relative_url }}">detecting ship-tracks</a>.

        This article from the Wall Street Journal explores the role of Amazon, Microsoft and Google in meeting the
        need for cloud-scale computing to tackle some of the largest climate research problems we face. It highlights my
        work on <a href="{{ 'projects/shiptracks.html' | relative_url }}">detecting ship-tracks</a> in vast quantities
        satellite imagery using Machine Learning on Amazon Web Services.

        In this podcast Philip Stier and I discuss the use of cloud computing for tackling some of the most pressing
        climate change questions, including for hosting large machine learning workflows such as the <a
              href="{{ 'projects/pocs.html' | relative_url }}">detection of pockets of open cells</a>. This was also
        featured in a <a
              href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/11/science-of-climate-change.html">blog post</a> by Amazon
        CTO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Vogels">Werner Vogels</a>.

        This article in Science magazine highlights our work using neural architecture search to develop fast,
        flexible emulators that are applicable to a wide range of physical simulators. These emulators are often
        orders of magnitude faster than the simulators they replicate and can allow solving inverse problems - that
        is, determining model inputs based on matching observable outputs.
