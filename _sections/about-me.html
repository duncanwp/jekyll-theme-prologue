<p align="left">I'm an atmospheric physicist working at the interface of climate research and machine learning.
Currently, my research focuses on understanding the interactions between aerosols and clouds, and their
representation within global climate models. These interactions are numerous and complex, involving
non-linearities and feedbacks which make modelling average responses to any perturbation in aerosol extremely challenging.
I'm leading the development of a variety of machine learning tools and techniques to alleviate these
difficulties and optimally combine a variety of observational datasets, including global satellite and aircraft
    measurements, to constrain and improve these models.</p>

<p align="left">I'm also keen to foster the application of machine learning to climate science questions more broadly and am Course
