<p align="left">I'm an atmospheric physicist working at the interface of climate research and machine learning.
The Climate Analytics Lab I lead focuses on understanding the interactions between aerosols and clouds, and their
representation within global climate models. These interactions are numerous and complex, involving
non-linearities and feedbacks which make modelling average responses to any perturbation in aerosol extremely challenging.
We're leading the development of a variety of machine learning tools and techniques to alleviate these
difficulties and optimally combine a variety of observational datasets, including global satellite and aircraft
    measurements, to constrain and improve these models.</p>

<p align="left">
  I'm also keen to foster the application of machine learning to climate science questions more broadly and convene the
    <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/43851">Machine
        Learning for Climate Science</a> EGU session and
  co-convene the “<a href="https://aiforgood.itu.int/eventcat/discovery-ai-and-climate-science/?post_type=event">AI and Climate Science,</a>” discovery series that is part of the United Nations’ AI for Good program.
