Large computer models requiring hundreds of input parameters, taking thousands of core-hours to run
, and producing terabytes of output are ubiquitous in the earth sciences. As I discuss in my recent [perspective
 paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0098), it is becoming
 common practice to develop emulators as fast approximations of these models in order to explore the relationships between these inputs and outputs, understand uncertainties and generate large ensembles datasets.

emulation of two climate model parameters" /></span>

Primarily, I build emulators using Gaussian Process regression across different (uncertain) input parameters in
 order to allow fast sampling for likelihood-free inference. (Basically determining the parameter combinations which
  produce outputs which are compatible with the available observations.) I've used this approach for
   constraining parametric
   uncertainty in both the [direct](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087141) and [first indirect
](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1922502117)
 aerosol effects.
 
I developed [ESEm](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2021-267/) as an [open source](https://github.
com/duncanwp/ESEm) tool providing a 
general workflow for emulating and validating a
 wide variety of climate models and outputs. It is built on well established, high performance libraries to
  ensure robustness, extensibility and scalability. I've also been involved with the development of a novel neural [architecture search algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08055) for general emulation of
 physical simulations, which was [higlighted by Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/models-galaxies-atoms-simple-ai-shortcuts-speed-simulations-billions-times).

I have also been developing a Climate model emulation becnhmark dataset called [ClimateBench](https://github.
com/duncanwp/ClimateBench) designed for scenario exploration and inspired by WeatherBench. It consists of NorESM2 
simulation outputs with associated forcing data processed in to a consistent format from a variety of experiments 
performed for CMIP6. Benchmark models and evaluation criteria are described in a forthcoming publication.
